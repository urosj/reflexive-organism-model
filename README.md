# Reflexive Organism Model

Reflexive organism model offers a unified framework and a language for reasoning how interacting parts self-assemble into an integrated whole, producing oneness and ordered structures, while evaluating those products through reflection.

## Core concepts

- **Oneness & Autonomy** - organisms retain individual agency while contributing to a coherent whole.  
- **Goal‑aligned Assembly** - encoded top-level objectives drive individual contributions.
- **Reflexive Experience** - how much the whole feels its own changes.

## Components of the model

- A general **reflexive organism model** that *writes* its own state to memory and later *reads* it, allowing the whole collective to reason about itself.
- Duality of **fast-slow reflexive loop** as the engine of the model in which fast “current‑like” dynamics (assembly, actuation) are coupled to slow “matter‑like” structures (memory, fields).
- **Hierarchical structure is intrinsic**. Each organism is composed of smaller units that can themselves also be organisms.
- **Direction of growth via Assembly Theory**. Direction of growth is no longer just counting numbers, but rather how to deal with complexity of assembly. We introduce global measure for an organism, the assembly index, then we make it local by introducing assembly tensors.
- **Measuring reflection via the Experience Index**. The experience index quantifies how much the system feels its own changes. Experience is also first measured globally through experience index, while later we introduce experience tensors to make it fine-grained, locally based,
- **Operators for information flow**. We introduce operators to set the boundaries when dealing with flow of information between layers of organisms.
- **Tie everything together: purpose function and rewards.** We introduce quantified _purposeful construction_ that simultaneously measures individuality, coherence and a self‑generated reward signal.

## Key implications and predictions

- Order and structure emerge through generalised second law of entropy (without violating it).
- Emergence of spacetime. Spacetime is not something external, it's emerges from the organism itself.
- Emergence of hierarchical proper time, different "clocks" coexists naturally.
- Memory‑driven self‑modulation reshapes the arrow of time, past activity stored in the graph topology influences future dynamics.
- Entangled subsystems share a common time reference as their joint record lives in a shared memory, thus spatially separated parts stay temporally coordinated.
- Experience turns rewards into intrinsic quantities, a self-generated drive that can be tuned by the organism itself.
- Experience as a mathematically tractable variable of self-awareness.
- No need for an external observer.

## Why it matters

- **Unified language for collectives.** The paper provides a single mathematical/semantic scaffold to describe ant colonies, forests, modular robots, and distributed software as *self‑aware superorganisms*.
- **Bridges biology & physics.** In the paper, we shows how classic electromagnetic and gravitational equations can emerge from memory‑feedback cycles, offering fresh perspectives on the “physics of life”.
- **Quantifies complexity.** The Assembly Index gives an objective metric to differentiate random aggregates from purposeful, evolved structures—useful for origin‑of‑life studies, synthetic biology and intelligent system design.
- **Guides engineering of adaptive systems.** By maximizing a dynamic decision functional $\mathcal{J}$ that balances structure and experience, designers can create robots or agents that *build* and *learn* together, not just one after the other.

## Vision

The vision for the project is to become a *living laboratory*, an open, interdisciplinary hub for the Reflexive Organism Model.

1. **Validate and extend the theory**, not just providing updates and corrections of the paper, but also to extend it across domains, such as communication algorithms, locomotion physics, biological morphogenesis, and even astrophysical pattern formation.
2. **Collect and share experiments**, either physical prototypes or simulations code, that probe any facet of the framework. From basic setups and dynamics, to high-level cooperative environments. Enabling researchers and engineers to **co‑create new theoretical insights** and **derive concrete engineering solutions** that embody the reflexive theory.
