## **RC-III: Emergent Agency in Reflexive Coherence Systems**

## **Abstract**

This paper develops **RC-III**, the phenomenological layer in which *discrete identity structures* emerge from the continuous RC-II field theory. Whereas RC-II provides a unified PDE framework for coherence, identity density, and geometry, RC-III describes *how certain localized, self-maintaining, and self-modifying structures behave as proto-agents*. RC-III formalizes the mechanisms observed empirically in RC-v12: spark-triggered nucleation, punctuated births, growth and decay cycles, global resource constraints, and geometry-mediated interactions among identities.

We interpret these mechanisms not as ad hoc additions but as **computational closures** that allow the RC-II field theory to express persistent, interacting localized entities. The resulting system constitutes a minimal, reflexive ecology: identities arise at instability loci, regulate their own coherence intake, perturb geometry in a way that stabilizes or destabilizes their environment, and exhibit rudimentary forms of sensing, action, competition, and territoriality.

RC-III is thus the first RC layer in which *agency*—in a minimal, emergent sense—appears.

## **1. Introduction**

The Reflexive Coherence program is now composed of three conceptual layers:

* **RC-I:** Single-field reflexive geometry (coherence ↔ geometry).
* **RC-II:** Continuous identity density field (coherence ↔ identity ↔ geometry).
* **RC-III:** *Discrete emergent identities* with semiautonomous lifecycles and interactions.

Paper 8 formalized RC-II as a continuous PDE system.
However, the dynamics observed in RC-v12 cannot be fully understood within RC-II alone: identities appear in discrete bursts, persist as individual localized structures, compete for coherence, collapse, and interact indirectly via geometry.

RC-III provides the conceptual and phenomenological formalism for these emergent **identity agents**.

## **2. From Continuous Fields to Discrete Identities**

RC-III introduces no new fundamental fields.
Instead, identities are defined as *localized compressions of the RC-II identity density*:

$$
I_k(x,t) \subset I(x,t),
$$

where the discrete identity index (k) is not an ontological primitive but a *tracking construct* imposed when the continuous identity field exhibits spatially separated peaks exceeding a mass threshold.

Thus, identities in RC-III obey:

* **ontological continuity:** arising from the RC-II identity density,
* **phenomenological discreteness:** tracked as individual entities when spatially distinct.

This resolves the conceptual duality between continuous RC-II dynamics and the discrete identity behavior observed in RC-v12.

## **3. Spark Manifolds as Proto-Perceptual Structures**

A **spark** is a point (or manifold) where:

1. the Hessian determinant of the coherence field is close to zero, and
2. the coherence gradient is locally maximal.

These regions act as **instability receptors**.
In RC-III we interpret them as *proto-perceptual sites*, because:

* the coherence geometry at a spark is ambiguous,
* the identity density at sparks can amplify small perturbations,
* spark patterns encode environmental structure around the coherence condensate.

Hence, sparks function as the *detection layer* through which identities “sense” the coherence field.

This is the origin of **spark-triggered birth**.

## **4. Birth, Persistence, and Collapse: Identity Life Cycles**

Identity dynamics in RC-III follow a three-stage life cycle.

### **4.1 Birth**

An identity is born when all of the following hold:

* spark manifold intensity exceeds a threshold,
* a minimal number of spark pixels exist
  (`spark_birth_sparks_min`),
* the global identity mass budget is not exhausted
  (`I_global_mass_cap`),
* and the birth interval timer has advanced.

These **global gates** ensure that identity birth is *punctuated* rather than continuous.

### **4.2 Growth and Persistence**

After birth, identity fields grow via the RC-II PDE:

$$
\partial_t I_k = g_{id} C I_k - d_{id} I_k + D_{id}\Delta I_k.
$$

Growth areas correspond to regions of strong coherence support.

Diffusion broadens the identity footprint; too much diffusion can dissipate a young identity before it stabilizes.

Geometry responds to identity through the (\eta_{id}) curvature term, creating local geometric *niches* that support identity persistence.

### **4.3 Collapse**

If the identity mass

$$
M_k = \int I_k dx < M_{\min},
$$

the identity is removed.

Collapse is analogous to metabolic starvation: insufficient coherence input leads to dissipation.

## **5. Identity–Coherence–Geometry Feedback Loops**

RC-III identities participate in a reflexive triad:

$$
I_k \leftrightarrow C \leftrightarrow g_{\mu\nu}.
$$

### **5.1 Identity → Coherence**

Via the α-source in RC-II, identity density reshapes coherence:

* producing local coherence influx where identities reside,
* drawing coherence away from low-identity regions,
* playing the role of a **resource attractor**.

### **5.2 Coherence → Identity**

Identities grow where coherence is high; coherence gradients shape identity structure and movement.

### **5.3 Identity → Geometry**

The η-curvature term introduces local geometric perturbations:

* identity presence steepens curvature,
* geometry can “trap” or “repel” identities,
* identities dynamically sculpt their environment.

Together these create **action–perception loops**:

* sparks are proto-perceptions of coherence structure,
* curvature perturbations are proto-actions on the geometric substrate.

## **6. Interaction Dynamics Among Identities**

Identities in RC-III interact at a distance through geometry and coherence redistribution.

### **6.1 Competition**

Multiple identities draw coherence from overlapping regions.
The α-source causes local increases at each identity’s location, but identities indirectly compete for the global coherence distribution preserved by mass invariance.

### **6.2 Cooperation / Stabilization**

Two identities may share a curvature niche, reinforcing one another’s stability through combined η-curvature effects.

### **6.3 Territoriality**

Geometric deformation induced by one identity may inhibit the creation or growth of others nearby, producing territorial spacing patterns reminiscent of Turing instabilities and ecological niche formation.

## **7. Reproducibility and Stochasticity**

Since spark selection and identity seeding involve random sampling from the spark mask:

* identity genealogies depend on random choice,
* repeated runs with the same seed reproduce identical sequences,
* stochasticity introduces diversity of outcomes without altering the underlying field dynamics.

RC-III thus sits between deterministic RC-II PDEs and stochastic ecological dynamics.

## **8. Agent Criteria in Reflexive Coherence**

Identities in RC-III exhibit several minimal agent-like properties:

### **8.1 Persistence**

They maintain a localized structure over time via reflexive coherence coupling.

### **8.2 Autonomy**

Their growth and decay depend on local field values rather than global commands.

### **8.3 Perception**

Sparks provide localized sensitivity to environmental geometry.

### **8.4 Action**

Identity-induced curvature shapes the geometry field, altering future coherence flows.

### **8.5 Interaction**

Identities affect one another indirectly through competition for coherence and geometry shaping.

While RC-III identities are not cognitive or intentional, they satisfy minimal criteria for **autonomous reflexive entities** within a field-theoretic ecology.

## **9. Relationship of RC-III to RC-II and RC-I**

### **RC-I:**

Coherence ↔ geometry, no identity fields.

### **RC-II:**

Coherence ↔ identity density ↔ geometry, fully continuous PDEs.

### **RC-III:**

Discrete identities emerge as tracked, interacting, lifecycled structures arising from RC-II dynamics plus computational closure rules (birth, collapse, mass gating).

Thus:

* RC-III is **not** a new mathematical layer,
* RC-III is a **phenomenological emergence layer** built on RC-II,
* RC-III identities are *not* fundamental field components; they are *coherent patterns* in the identity density.

## **10. Conclusion**

RC-III provides the conceptual closure to the RC-II field theory. It explains how the continuous identity density of RC-II gives rise to localized, discrete, quasi-autonomous identity structures: entities that exhibit perception-like sensitivity to spark patterns, action-like geometric modulation, competition, cooperation, and persistence.

RC-III establishes that Reflexive Coherence is not only a theory of geometric self-organization, but also a theory of **emergent agency** arising naturally in field systems with reflexive couplings.

Future work may examine:

* multi-identity ecologies,
* communication fields,
* higher-order reflexive layers,
* and the emergence of memory, intention, or adaptive behavior.

RC-III closes the foundational tier of the Reflexive Coherence hierarchy and opens the path to RC-IV and beyond.
