# Investigations

Some topics are not fit to be included in the paper and yet feel fun to explore and experiment with. Either as a deep-dive of some particular property of the model, or a potential application, or simply an exploration of an alternative. This section contains such topics; self-contained expansions without breaking paper's coherence which I call investigations.

## Investigations

- **[Reflexive loop](2025-10-Living-ROM.md)**: A simple heuristics that shows how to use the model in practice by focusing on how to reason about assembly and experience and how to quantify them. The explanation is applicative in nature. The description should be self-sufficient and doesn't require detailed understanding of the model. It is rather aimed at initial understanding and application of reflexive loops through daily activity. It can be used either as an additional informational dimension of ongoing processes, or as a design guideline of a new self-regulating system.
