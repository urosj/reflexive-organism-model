# Investigations

Some topics are not fit to be included in the paper and yet feel fun to explore and experiment with. Either as a deep-dive of some particular property of the model, or a potential application, or simply an exploration of an alternative. This section contains such topics; self-contained expansions without breaking paper's coherence which I call investigations.

## Investigations

- **[Reflexive loop](2025-10-Living-ROM.md)**: A simple heuristics that shows how to use the model in practice by focusing on how to reason about assembly and experience and how to quantify them. The explanation is applicative in nature. The description should be self-sufficient and doesn't require detailed understanding of the model. It is rather aimed at initial understanding and application of reflexive loops through daily activity. It can be used either as an additional informational dimension of ongoing processes, or as a design guideline of a new self-regulating system.

- **[Seeds of life](2025-11-SeedsOfLife.md)**: This work extends the Reflexive Organism Model (ROM) by introducing **seeds** as the fundamental curvature that shapes how living systems form, stabilize, and evolve. A seed encodes structural biases in the reflexive field, making certain patterns naturally self-reinforcing. We distinguish **genetic seeds**, encoded in DNA, from **experiential seeds** that arise from recurrent currents; both require a **spark**—a symmetry-breaking surge of coherence—to activate into autonomous reflexive loops. Biological processes such as fertilization, cell division, and colony organization, as well as cognitive and cultural development, are shown to follow this same seed–spark–eigenmode mechanism. This unifies life, learning, and evolution under a single principle: **organisms are self-maintaining coherence modes, and evolution is the refinement of the curvature that sustains them**.

- **[Coherence](2025-11-Coherence.md)**: We introduce coherence as the central invariant of the Reflexive Organism Model (ROM), defined as the conserved product of structure, experience, and compatibility. Expressing this quantity as a scalar field and tensor on the organism’s internal manifold clarifies how seed-imposed curvature generates eigenmodes and attractor basins, extending the geometric intuition developed in ROM. While reserve dynamics govern when systems grow, reorganize, or conserve themselves, coherence explains how identity is preserved throughout these transformations.
