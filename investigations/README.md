# Investigations

Some topics are not fit to be included in the paper and yet feel fun to explore and experiment with. Either as a deep-dive of some particular property of the model, or a potential application, or simply an exploration of an alternative. This section contains such topics; self-contained expansions without breaking paper's coherence which I call investigations.

## Investigations

| Paper | Short abstract |
|-------|----------------|
| **[Reflexive loop](2025-10-Living-ROM.md)** | A simple heuristics that shows how to use the model in practice by focusing on how to reason about assembly and experience and how to quantify them. The explanation is applicative in nature. The description should be self-sufficient and doesn't require detailed understanding of the model. It is rather aimed at initial understanding and application of reflexive loops through daily activity. It can be used either as an additional informational dimension of ongoing processes, or as a design guideline of a new self-regulating system. |
| **[Seeds of life](2025-11-SeedsOfLife.md)** | This work extends the Reflexive Organism Model (ROM) by introducing seeds as the fundamental curvature that shapes how living systems form, stabilize, and evolve. A seed encodes structural biases in the reflexive field, making certain patterns naturally self-reinforcing. We distinguish genetic seeds, encoded in DNA, from experiential seeds that arise from recurrent currents; both require a spark—a symmetry-breaking surge of coherence—to activate into autonomous reflexive loops. Biological processes such as fertilization, cell division, and colony organization, as well as cognitive and cultural development, are shown to follow this same seed–spark–eigenmode mechanism. This unifies life, learning, and evolution under a single principle: organisms are self-maintaining coherence modes, and evolution is the refinement of the curvature that sustains them. |
| **[Coherence](2025-11-Coherence.md)** | We introduce coherence as the central invariant of the Reflexive Organism Model (ROM), defined as the conserved product of structure, experience, and compatibility. Expressing this quantity as a scalar field and tensor on the organism’s internal manifold clarifies how seed-imposed curvature generates eigenmodes and attractor basins, extending the geometric intuition developed in ROM. While reserve dynamics govern when systems grow, reorganize, or conserve themselves, coherence explains how identity is preserved throughout these transformations. And ultimately suggests a coherence-only interpretation in which all internal geometry arises from a single underlying field. |
| **[Reflexive coherence](2025-11-ReflexiveCoherence.md)** | We present a coherence-only formulation of the Reflexive Organism Model, in which a single dynamical field generates all organismal structure and behavior through its induced geometry. Identity basins, reconfiguration, learning, and environmental coupling emerge from coherence potential and flux, while reproduction and pruning correspond to topology changes in the coherence landscape. The entire organismal dynamics thus reduce to the conservation, redistribution, and curvature of one scalar field. |
| **[Reflexive Coherence: A Geometric Theory of Identity, Choice, and Abundance](2025-11-RC-IdentityChoiceAbundance.md)** | This work describes the phenomenology that emerges from Reflexive Coherence, where identity corresponds to stable attractor basins and choice arises from multi-attractor geometry. Collapse events, which resolve these configurations, are computationally irreducible and produce the lived sense of uncertainty and agency. Curvature instabilities (“sparks”) generate new identities, driving coherence systems toward increasing structural abundance. |
| **[Fractal Reflective Coherence](2025-11-FractalReflexiveCoherence.md)** | Fractal Reflexive Coherence (FRC) extends the Reflexive Coherence framework by promoting coherence to a scale‑resolved density $C(x,t;\sigma)$ on the product manifold $\Omega_t\times[0,\infty)_\sigma$. A position–scale continuity equation with a scale flux $J^\sigma$ generates an infinite cascade of coupled reflexive loops while preserving a strict global coherence invariant. The contributions from all scales are superposed into an integrated coherence tensor that defines the organism’s geometry, giving rise to multiscale identity basins and fractal self‑organization. This deterministic, variational formulation provides a unified mechanism for hierarchical, scale‑free patterns in biological, cognitive, and collective systems. |
| **[RC with PDEs and identities addon](../experiments/RC-PDE/experiments/7-IdentitiesAddon.md)** | The paper describes the most complete implementation, however with an additional layer that deals wiht identites. The framewroks is useful for design and analysis of field-defined identities and dynamics betwen "ecosystem" of such agents. This is the 7-th paper in the series of 10 papers that describe experiments and observations done with this PoC model. |
| **[Graph Reflexive Coherence](2025-12-GRC-V2.md)** | We provide a complete, unified formulation of Reflexive Coherence on a weighted graph. The definition is written as a closed reflexive loop (the same logical cycle that exists in the PDE theory) together with the *derived* notions of identity basins, sparks, seeds/front propagation and abundance, plus a set of minimal extensions that restore curvature, smooth front dynamics, analytical tractability and exact invariants. |
| **G-RC implementation** | *Ongoing* |
| **[Reflexive Coherence Dynamics](2025-12-Observations.md)** | This work addresses a structural gap between reflexive theoretical models of identity and their concrete dynamical realizations by (i) formalizing the minimal dynamical requirements implied by the theory, (ii) proving a precise obstruction for a large class of continuum models, and (iii) introducing a minimal discrete extension that overcomes this obstruction while preserving the theoretical principles. |
