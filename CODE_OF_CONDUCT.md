# Code of Conduct

**Short version:** Be kind, be constructive, and help us keep this a welcoming place for everyone.

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and maintainers, pledge to make participation in **Reflexive Organism Model** a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Showing empathy and respect for different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Being considerate in word and deed; assuming good intent and asking for clarification

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment; publishing others’ private information without permission (“doxing”)
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, derogatory or demeaning comments, and personal or political attacks
- Excessive or aggressive “bike-shedding,” off-topic disruption, or repeated bad-faith criticism
- Violent threats or encouragement of self-harm or harm to others

## Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces and when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. That includes repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, wikis, documentation, chat/voice channels, conferences, and social media.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers and moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact the repository owner directly.

Reports should include:

- What happened and when (links/screenshots if possible)
- Where it occurred (repo/issue/PR/discussion/event)
- Who was involved and whether they are aware of the report
- Your preferred contact method and whether you want the report kept confidential from the reported person (we try to honor confidentiality but may need to share minimal details to investigate)

The team will acknowledge receipt within 10 business days and aim to provide an initial assessment or next steps within 20 days. The team will respect reporters’ privacy and will not publicly name reporters without explicit consent, except if required by law or if there is an imminent risk of harm.

## Enforcement Guidelines

When addressing violations, maintainers will use these guidelines to determine impact and consequences:

1. **Correction**
   - *Community Impact:* Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome but isolated.
   - *Consequence:* A private, written warning and guidance on expected behavior.

2. **Warning**
   - *Community Impact:* A single significant incident or a pattern of behavior that is not appropriate.
   - *Consequence:* A warning with consequences for continued behavior. May include temporary restrictions (e.g., posting limited to specific threads).

3. **Temporary Suspension**
   - *Community Impact:* A serious violation or continued inappropriate behavior after a warning.
   - *Consequence:* Temporary ban from project spaces and participation for 90 days. Conditions for return will be outlined.

4. **Permanent Ban**
   - *Community Impact:* Demonstrating a pattern of harassment or hostility; threats of violence; or behavior that poses a safety risk.
   - *Consequence:* Permanent removal from all project spaces. Any future participation requires explicit approval by the maintainers.

This Code of Conduct is inspired by community standards from open-source projects and professional organizations. You are welcome to adapt it for your own project.
